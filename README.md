# dumb v smart

-- Can Dumb Beat Smart?

##BACKGROUND
It is widely believe, smarter is always better. In many cases, the smart wins largely because it has more prior knowledge, which the dumb does't have, and the smart workes harder than the dumb.  In wireless communication and networking, the prior knowledge usually includes the information of next channel condition, the transmission timing and transmission power of other coexiting users.  In the literature, knowing prior knowledge have long been established and demonstrated to be beneficial in achieving optimal performance in uplink access probes design and advance multiuser receiver design, especially comparing with simple and "dumb" traditional approaches.  

In this random access channel design project, I, however, want to show that due to many implementation limitations and considerations, the dumb may sometimes win also, even though it has the least prior knowledge (e.g., the tranmission power and timing) of others users.  At the very early beginning when I was working for LG Electronics Mobile Research on a project in 2005 for impproving the reverse link channel capcity of 3G/CDMA2000. At that time after Hurrican
Katrine disaster, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina, the industry realized the limitations of existing ALOHA based reverse link design in 3G mobile network.  However, besides the group-based prioritization on random channel accesses, the indstry couldn't be able to figure out any reasonable and feasible systematic change for solving the possible reverse-link access congestion issue.


Later in 2011 with the emerging of M2M or IoT devices and services, the industry then predicted that there would be another acccess congestion issue, providing millions or even billions of low-cost IoT devices to be deployed in the 3G/3.5G/4G mobile networks. As such, I made another contribution to 3GPP2 with proposing dumbe, low rate and low power access probes.  Eventually this contribution was accepted by 3GPP2 after harmonzed with Qualcomm's framework contributions.  


##WHAT IS THE SMARTNESS DISCUSSED HERE?




The principle of the dumb access protocol suggested here can be used for improving random access capacity.  The targeted applications, for example, includes improving IoT network capacity.
