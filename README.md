# dumb v smart

## Can Dumb Beat Smart?
It is widely believe that smarter is always better. In many cases, the smart wins because it has the prior knowledge, which the dumb does't have.  In wireless communication and networking, the prior knowledge usually includes the channel condition, the transmission timing and power of other users in the same channel.  In the existing literatures, the benefits of knowing prior knowledge have been demonstrated forachiving optimial performance in the access channel design of wireless networks and advance receiver design in multiuser signal processing.  In this project of random access channel design, I, however, want to show that due to many implementation limitations and considerations, the dumb may sometimes win also, even though it has the least prior knowledge (e.g., the tranmission power and timing) of others users.

The principle of the dumb access protocol suggested here can be used for improving random access capacity.  The targeted applications, for example, includes improving IoT network capacity.
